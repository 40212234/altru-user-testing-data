                            <blockquote>Participant 12: "I like the layout, the use of videos etc. to get your attention and the simplicity. I don't like so much how there isn't much to say in the About section and how you have to log in to do more than read a bit about it."</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Participant 13: "The video was good but might have benefited from brief narrative. The layout is good and the general design. Would prefer to have a bit more upfront information about the company/organistation"</blockquote>
